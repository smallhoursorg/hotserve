// Package proof is the box channel's proof core: it decides whether a
// bundle — a Caddyfile, the commit object that is claimed to contain
// it, the trees on the path between them, and the first-parent chain
// down to the commit the box runs — is what it claims to be. Every
// check is from bytes: ids are computed, never read; a signature is
// ssh-keygen's verdict on the commit object with its gpgsig header
// removed, against the signer list of the Caddyfile the box runs.
//
// The package is stdlib plus golang.org/x/crypto/ssh (key parsing) and
// imports nothing of Caddy's, so the applier's root-side checks and the
// handler's pre-check (DESIGN-box.md, steps 5 and 11–14) run the same
// code with the same messages.

// derived itself. An error that is not a Refusal is the box's own
// trouble (ssh-keygen could not be run), not a verdict on the push.
