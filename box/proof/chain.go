// Chain is step 14's walk: first parents from head until baseline,
// through the bundled parent objects in the order the workflow listed
// them (`parents/0001` first), linked by hash, not by position: each
// entry's computed id must equal the previous commit's first `parent`
// header, and the walk ends when a first `parent` header equals the
// baseline — whose object is not bundled. An entry past that point, or
// one that is not the first parent of the commit before it, is a
// malformed bundle. It returns the chain, head first — every commit on
// it must then carry a signature the box accepts (VerifyChain). HEAD
// is always on the chain, so it is never empty: when HEAD is the
// baseline the chain is HEAD alone, its signature is still checked
// against the installed list, and no parent may be bundled. A walk
// that runs out of parents, or of bundled objects, before it reaches
// the baseline is a history that no longer contains the commit the box
// runs on its first-parent line, refused with the message that names
// the three ways that happens. A chain of more than MaxChain commits,
// HEAD counted, is refused with the message that names the reset; the
// workflow checks the same bound before it posts.

// VerifyChain is steps 12 and 14 together: every commit of the chain

// signers, within one deadline for the whole chain over and above each
// child's. It returns the principal whose key signed head. Head's own
// refusals are the named ones (not signed, OpenPGP, not a signer, a
// signature that does not verify). A commit between the baseline and
// head is refused by what its verdict was: unsigned, or signed by
// anything but an SSH key, gets the message that says to rebase it
// away and force-push, no baseline change — an unsigned commit a
// leaked credential pushed would otherwise ride into the box under the
// next signed one; signed by a key the box did not list when it last
// applied gets the message that names the principal the incoming file
// gives that key, because the commit that adds the key must apply
// before the commits it signs, or says the new file does not list it
// either; a listed key whose signature does not verify keeps its own
// message. An error that is not a verdict — ssh-keygen could not run,
// the deadline passed — is returned as it is, never as a refusal.
