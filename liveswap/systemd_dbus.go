// session bus, no polkit: the socket is owned by our uid and answers
// only to it, and it exists whenever user@<uid>.service is running
// (lingering keeps it running with nobody logged in).
//
// The connection is dialed lazily and shared process-wide: pooled
// managedApps outlive any one config, so it belongs to the process,

// redials; callers see the error of the call that hit it.
