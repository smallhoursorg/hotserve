# sandbox-view.sh — the VIEW PROBE. It runs inside a sandboxed app unit
# and records what the sandbox looks like from within: one `k=v` line
# per check, written into the app's shared dir (the one writable,
# persistent path in the view) where each test lane reads it back.
#
# Deliberately not executable: every lane SOURCES it (see below), so
# that `pid` below is the unit's main process rather than a child of
# it. (Resource limits are inherited unchanged, so `nofile_*` would be
# right either way — the pid is the whole reason.)
#
# Not to be confused with the CAPABILITY PROBE (probeSandboxCapability,
# liveswap/sandbox.go), which is production code that runs a throwaway
# unit at App.Start to decide whether this host can deliver a sandbox
# at all. This file is a test fixture and ships in no release.
#
# One asset, three lanes: liveswap's integration test embeds it, the
# e2e artifacts image bakes it into a release tarball, and the
# packaging smoke test mounts it into its container. It lives in this
# module's testdata because being *embedded* is what makes editing it
# invalidate the Go test cache — read from outside the module, both Go
# lanes silently returned a cached pass when only this file changed.
# Keeping one copy is the point: three copies drifted on fifteen keys,
# and one of them had stopped testing that /etc/ssl/private stays out
# of the view (#72).
#
# Each lane wraps it in its own ./server, which SOURCES this file and
# then becomes whatever that lane needs (a sleep, the demo app,
# `hotserve respond`). Sourced rather than run as a child so that `$$`
# below is the unit's main pid — which is the assertion that the PID
# namespace is in effect at all.
#
# Paths are derived from the working directory — the release dir,
# <root>/<app>/releases/<version> — so this works for any root and any
# app name. Three facts cannot be derived, because the sandbox is what
# hides them, and arrive as environment:
#
#   MGR_PID         the user manager's pid, as seen on the host
#   PROBE_DNS_NAME  a name to resolve, proving DNS works from inside
#   HOTSERVE_UID    the uid hotserve runs as
#
# HOTSERVE_UID is the one with a defensible default: apps run as the
# hotserve user and PrivateUsers= maps that uid to itself, so `id -u`
# in here IS hotserve's uid. Rather than trust that, the probe emits
# the value it actually used as `uid`, and the lane compares it against
# the uid it looked up from outside — proving the manager-socket path
# below is the real one rather than merely absent.
#
# A check whose input is missing emits `skipped` rather than nothing.
# That is deliberate: a lane that silently lost its input must fail an
# assertion, not pass vacuously. Every key below is emitted on every
# run, in every lane.
