// The app-name and version alphabets, and the two helpers over them.
// Every layer of the package shares this vocabulary — the unit name a
// runner builds, the directory a release lands in, the name the
// webhook echoes back — so it lives on its own rather than in the
// config file that happens to validate against it.

// appNameMaxLen bounds an app name; it is also how much of a
// request-supplied name the webhook is willing to log.

// versionRe is the tag alphabet: the Nomad-era webhook's set, minus a
// leading dot. The alphabet has no path separator, so no tag can
// escape releases/; the leading dot is refused because the releases
// dir uses it for its own bookkeeping — ".extract-<version>" is the
// staging dir a deploy renames into place, and release GC removes any
// ".extract-*" it finds as a crash orphan and skips every other
// dot-entry as a stray. A version named ".extract-1" would therefore
// be deleted by the GC of the deploy that installed it, and ".v1"
// would never be listed or pruned. "." and ".." fall out of the same
// rule (both would resolve releases/<version> onto the releases dir
// itself or the app root — where shared/ lives).

// versionPathComponent renders a version tag safe to use as a single
// path component, mechanically: rooting the string at "/" and cleaning
// resolves any "..", and the leading separator is then stripped. For
// every tag validVersion accepts this is the identity function (the
// tag alphabet contains no separators), so it changes no behavior —
// it is belt-and-braces beneath validVersion, which remains the real
// gate. It also uses the exact idiom static analysis models as a
// path-traversal sanitizer (CodeQL's FilepathCleanSanitizer), so the
// version->filesystem flows stop lighting up go/path-injection at
// every join downstream. (Tested for both properties.)
func versionPathComponent(v string) string {
	return strings.TrimPrefix(filepath.Clean("/"+v), "/")

// validVersion reports whether v is an acceptable version tag: the
// gate every version passes before it reaches a filesystem path (see
// versionRe for what the alphabet refuses and why). FuzzDeployRequest
// pins the filesystem property behind it.
