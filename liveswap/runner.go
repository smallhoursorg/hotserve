// runner abstracts how app instances are executed so the orchestration
// pipeline in app.go is testable with a fake. The one production
// implementation is systemdRunner (runner_systemd.go): every instance
// is a transient systemd service unit under the hotserve user's own
// service manager, which is what lets apps outlive hotserve restarts.
// exitError is the runner's report of a unit that ran and failed: how
// its process ended, in which unit, with what job, and the pid the
// manager recorded for that process (0 where it recorded none). The
// deploy's failure detail reads the exit, and finds the process's
// lines in the journal by the pid; the text is what each error always
// said — RunOnce's "exit status 3 (unit X: job failed)", Start's
// "unit X: start job failed (exit status 3)" — so nothing parsing the
// response's top-level error sees a change.
