// RefetchInterval is the most often a token makes the box try an
// issuer's discovery, until one succeeds, or fetch its keys. Both run
// in the background, and no token waits on either (#306): a token's
// verdict comes from what the process holds for the issuer
// (issuerState, shared by every source that trusts it), in the time of
// a local check whether or not its app exists. A start or a reload
// (Warm) runs the discovery and fetches the keys whatever this
// interval says; after that the keys are fetched only for a token
// whose kid the set holds no key for: so a key rotation — a new key
// under a new kid — is refused for the first token under the new key,
// which begins the fetch when this long has passed since the last,
// and the deploy's retry once the fetch has ended goes through (the
// templates' scripts send a refused Actions token once more, 3s
// later). A key replaced under the same kid does not reach it: its
// tokens fail under the held key, which never fetches, until a fetch
// for another kid or a reload.

// not, and waits on the fetch: a forged token naming the issuer cost
// the box an outbound round trip each, and its timing said the app
// exists. Here a signature is judged against the keys the set holds,
// on the spot. A token whose kid the set holds no key for begins a
// fetch in the background, at most once per RefetchInterval and one at
// a time, and is refused without waiting on it. Until the interval has
// passed, the last fetch's outcome stands: its keys, or, when it
// failed, its error — so during an outage a token the box holds no key
// for is still the outage's (unavailable), not a refusal of its own.
