// The on-disk layout every other file addresses an app's files
// through. Pure path arithmetic over one root and one app name: it
// holds no state, takes no lock, and knows nothing about the deploy
// pipeline, which is why it is not in app.go.

// appDirs is the on-disk layout for one app:
//
//	<root>/<app>/releases/<version>/   one dir per deployed version
//	<root>/<app>/shared/               persistent data, survives deploys
//	<root>/<app>/tmp/                  download staging
//	<root>/<app>/run/<nonce>/app.sock  one socket per instance, bound by the app; only run/<nonce>/ is in that instance's view
//	<root>/<app>/proxy/<nonce>.sock    the same inode, hard-linked by hotserve; what it dials (not in any view)
//	<root>/<app>/deploys/<version>.json  the latest deploy's outcome for that version, filtered (not in any view)
//	<root>/<app>/state.json            current version + process handle
//	<root>/<app>/deploying.json        a URL or push deploy in flight (deploying.go; not in any view)
//	<root>/<app>/current -> releases/<version>   convenience symlink
