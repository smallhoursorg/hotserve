// The start-time sweep of apps no loaded config names. It drives the
// runner, but every question it asks is a module-layer one — what the

// owns — so it lives here rather than in runner_systemd.go.

// replaced holds its own throughout, so nothing a sweep judges
// "unknown" can belong to a config that is or may yet be serving.
//
// Tests substitute their own ledger through the seam below. It is an
// atomic rather than a plain var because the sweep runs on a goroutine
// nothing joins: a test restoring the seam can overlap a sweep still
// reading it. nil = the pool.
