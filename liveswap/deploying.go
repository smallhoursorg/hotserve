// The deploy marker, <app>/deploying.json: a URL or push deploy in
// flight. Such a deploy extracts a release that it removes again if
// it fails; a hotserve that stops during it (a crash, a restart, an
// upgrade) removes nothing, and the release would stay under the
// version's name — a redeploy refused as "already exists", a rollback
// launching it without its pre_start (#318). The marker says which
// release that is. Its rules (DESIGN-liveswap.md):
//
//   - Written before the deploy extracts, and only by a deploy that
//     extracts: a rollback or a relaunch launches a release already
//     on disk, which nothing here may remove.
//   - Removed once the deploy's record is written, whatever the deploy
//     came to, so a marker that outlives its deploy is one no hotserve
//     finished, or one whose removal failed after its record was
//     written — told apart by the record's start time.
//   - Settled (settleInterrupted) only after a confirmed sweep, by
//     recovery and by the next deploy, each holding deployMu: nothing
//     runs out of the release by then, and no deploy writes a marker
//     meanwhile. Settling never refuses anything: what it cannot tell
//     or cannot remove ends as a failed deploy's release left on disk
//     does, and the marker goes either way, so one slot never holds
//     two deploys.
//
// It lives beside state.json, outside every view, written and read
// under ownfile.go's rules.
