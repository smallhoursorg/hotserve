// a rollback target from (listReleases, the status's

// must agree, so the key and the sort are written once, here.
//
// The key is an input to what retention deletes — the way back, which
// nothing else holds — so it is held to the deploy store's rule 1
// (deploys.go): nothing the app can write decides it. A release dir's
// modification time is not such a key: the release being started is
// bound read-write into its sandbox (sandbox.go), so its pre_start and
// its instance can set that dir's mtime to anything, future included.
// The key is the release's deploy record's write time — when hotserve
// last deployed or rolled back to that version — read off the open
// record (readOwnFile) in a directory no app's view holds, and only
// from a record that proves itself one. Three refinements:
//
//   - In GC, the version the deploy promoted is newest — it was
//     deployed now, and its record is written as the deploy returns —
//     and the version it replaced, the way back, comes next, whatever
//     its record says: a rollback whose record write was lost (a
//     crash after the cutover, a full disk) leaves that version's
//     record at an older deploy, and it must not be pruned for that.
//     The status lists the running version first for the same reason:
//     it is the next deploy's way back, so the list and the next GC
//     agree.
//   - A release whose latest deploy failed — a rollback to it that
//     failed, or a failed deploy whose release was left on disk —
//     comes after every release whose latest deploy succeeded: that
//     deploy never served, and must take no place from one that did.
//   - A release with no such record — deployed before records
//     existed, or its record could not be written — comes after every
//     release that has one, ordered among its kind by its dir's mtime,
//     and the status names it (ordered_by_mtime). That mtime is the
//     app's to move, so it decides nothing among recorded releases:
//     such a release is the first GC candidate after the two held by
//     rank, and a rollback target while it is on disk.
