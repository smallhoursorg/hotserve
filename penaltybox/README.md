# penaltybox

A Caddy v2 module that turns an origin's **rate-limit hint header** into
edge-side throttling using the classic **penalty box** pattern: every
origin response labeled `X-Rate-Limit-Level: 2` or `3` adds weighted
units to a per-client sliding-window budget; a client that exceeds the
budget is put in a penalty box and gets `429` + `Retry-After` — before
its requests reach the origin — until the box expires. The hint header
is stripped before the response reaches the client.

If you know [Fastly's penalty boxes][fastly-concepts] or HAProxy's
[stick tables][haproxy-docs], you already understand this module — it is
the deliberate Caddy counterpart to those recipes, with matching
vocabulary. Caddy needs a compiled-in module for this because it has no
edge scripting runtime, and existing rate-limit plugins are
request-side only: they cannot see an **origin response** header.

## The wire contract

The module consumes a response header (default `X-Rate-Limit-Level`)
with the strict value set `"1"`, `"2"`, or `"3"` — the **recommended
throttle strictness** of the response, never enforcement:

- **Absent header, or any other value (garbage, `"0"`, `"4"`, padded,
  multi-valued) = level 1.** Malformed input never counts and never
  errors.
- Levels at or above `min_level` (default 2) add `level` units to the
  client's window — a level-3 login attempt costs 3 units, level-1
  traffic costs nothing and allocates nothing.

Any application can emit this header; the module is not specific to any
CMS. It pairs with an app that labels sensitive routes (logins, presign
endpoints, expensive queries) with higher levels.

## Install

```sh
xcaddy build --with github.com/hotsauce-team/hotserve/penaltybox
```

Or with the Caddy builder image:

```dockerfile
FROM caddy:2.11.4-builder AS builder
RUN xcaddy build --with github.com/hotsauce-team/hotserve/penaltybox

FROM caddy:2.11.4
COPY --from=builder /usr/bin/caddy /usr/bin/caddy
```

## Caddyfile

```caddyfile
example.com {
	route {
		hint_penaltybox {
			header      X-Rate-Limit-Level  # default; the wire contract
			key         {client_ip}         # default
			min_level   2                   # default; ignore level-1 responses
			window      60s                 # sliding window
			limit       30                  # weighted units per window before boxing
			penalty_ttl 5m                  # box duration (fixed, never extended)
			strip       true                # default
			status      429                 # default
			max_keys    100000              # default; tracked-client cap
		}
		reverse_proxy localhost:8000
	}
}
```

Outside a `route` block the directive orders itself before
`reverse_proxy` automatically; inside `route` ordering is positional, so
place it before your proxy/file-server directive.

All options and defaults:

| Option        | Default              | Meaning                                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `header`      | `X-Rate-Limit-Level` | Origin response header carrying the hint level                       |
| `key`         | `{client_ip}`        | Client identity; respects the server's `trusted_proxies` config      |
| `min_level`   | `2`                  | Lowest level that counts toward the budget (1–3)                     |
| `window`      | `60s`                | Sliding window; free-form duration (Fastly's 1s/10s/60s is the interoperability convention) |
| `limit`       | `30`                 | Weighted units per window; *exceeding* (not reaching) it boxes       |
| `penalty_ttl` | `5m`                 | Box duration; Fastly allows 1m–1h — mirror that range for doc parity |
| `strip`       | `true`               | Remove the hint header before the client sees it (all responses)     |
| `status`      | `429`                | Status for boxed clients (4xx/5xx)                                   |
| `max_keys`    | `100000`             | Hard cap on tracked clients; oldest-idle evicted beyond it           |

### Per-tier budgets

A single `(window, limit)` pair cannot express a two-tier policy like
"5 login attempts per 15 minutes" *and* "30 elevated operations per
minute" — tuning for one strangles the other. `tier` blocks give each
hint level its own budget:

```caddyfile
hint_penaltybox {
	tier 3 {
		window      15m
		limit       5     # five level-3 responses — logins, say
		penalty_ttl 30m   # security offenses earn longer boxes
	}
	tier 2 {
		window      60s
		limit       30
		penalty_ttl 5m
	}
}
```

Semantics:

- **Within a tier, one response costs 1** — `limit 5` means five
  level-3 responses, not weighted units. (Weighting only matters when
  levels share a budget; inside a single-level tier it would be a
  constant multiplier.)
- **Budgets are independent.** Level-2 traffic never consumes tier 3's
  budget, and vice versa — this is the point of the feature.
- **Fallback:** a counted level without its own tier uses the nearest
  configured tier below it (a level-3 response is at least as sensitive
  as level 2); if none, the default top-level budget, which keeps the
  original weighted semantics.
- **Boxing is whole-client:** crossing any tier's limit boxes the key
  for all traffic, with that tier's `penalty_ttl`. `Retry-After` is the
  remaining time of the longest active box.
- **Omitted tier fields inherit** the top-level `window`, `limit`, and
  `penalty_ttl`.
- Configs without `tier` blocks behave exactly as before.

The vendor parallel holds: Fastly expresses this as multiple
`ratecounter`/`penaltybox` pairs, HAProxy as separate `gpc` counters.

JSON config uses the same fields under `http.handlers.hint_penaltybox`
(tiers keyed by level):

```json
{
	"handler": "hint_penaltybox",
	"min_level": 2,
	"window": "60s",
	"limit": 30,
	"penalty_ttl": "5m",
	"tiers": {
		"3": { "window": "15m", "limit": 5, "penalty_ttl": "30m" }
	}
}
```

Do **not** key on a raw `X-Forwarded-For` read: the default
`{client_ip}` already honors the server's
[`trusted_proxies`](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#trusted-proxies)
configuration, which is where XFF trust belongs.

## Semantics and trade-offs (read this)

- **Reactive by design.** A client gets a budget's worth of full-cost
  requests before the box closes. Sustained abuse (credential stuffing,
  presign farming) is the threat this addresses — not the first hit.
- **Boxing is strict-greater.** With `limit 30`, thirty units is still
  allowed; the response that pushes past 30 gets through (its hint is
  what triggers boxing) and the *next* request is rejected.
- **`Retry-After` is honest**: the ceiling of the *remaining* box
  seconds, not the configured TTL.
- **The box TTL is fixed** (Fastly semantics). Traffic during the box
  neither counts nor extends the penalty; after expiry the budget
  restarts from zero.
- **State is per-instance and in-memory.** N Caddy instances ≈ N× the
  effective threshold. A config reload resets counters and boxes
  (fails open). Distributed state is a possible future addition — the
  counter store sits behind a small interface for exactly that reason.
- **Memory is hard-bounded.** At most `max_keys` clients are tracked;
  an attacker rotating IPs exhausts the cap into evictions, not into
  unbounded memory. Actively boxed entries are the last to be evicted.

## Compatibility with Souin (HTTP cache)

The e2e suite builds and tests the module alongside
[Souin](https://github.com/darkweak/souin) with
[Otter](https://github.com/darkweak/storages) storage. Place
`hint_penaltybox` **before** `cache` in the route:

```caddyfile
route {
	hint_penaltybox { ... }
	cache
	reverse_proxy localhost:8000
}
```

With that order (all verified by `make e2e`):

- Boxed clients get `429` before the cache — no free cached reads while
  boxed.
- Souin stores the upstream response *including* the hint header, so
  **cache hits replay the hint through the module**: hits count toward
  the budget exactly like origin responses, and a client hammering a
  cached level-3 URL still gets boxed.
- The header is stripped from every client-facing response, cache hit
  or miss — it lives only inside the cache store.

(If you instead put `cache` before `hint_penaltybox`, cache hits bypass
the module entirely: stored responses are already stripped, but boxed
clients can keep reading cached pages and hits never count.)

## Development

No local Go toolchain needed — everything runs in Docker:

```sh
make test              # unit tests (race detector, coverage)
make test-integration  # caddytest harness against an in-process Caddy
make e2e               # xcaddy build (incl. Souin+Otter) + stub origin + curl scenarios
make lint              # golangci-lint
```

CI runs the identical targets.
