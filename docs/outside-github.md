# Deploying from outside GitHub

[Your first deploy](first-deploy.md) deploys from GitHub Actions, with
a token GitHub mints for each run and nothing stored anywhere. The box
takes more than that: a token from any other CI's OpenID Connect
(OIDC) issuer, GitLab's among them, or a token you mint yourself with
a key, from a runner that has no OIDC at all, or from a laptop. This
page walks through those: choosing the trust, a key end to end, an
app's deploy and the box's own config from another runner, and
minting a token where there is no Linux `hotserve` to mint it with.

Everything here is the box's `deploy_trust` block, whose reference is
in [liveswap/README.md](../liveswap/README.md#deploy-authentication-deploy_trust).
Names are the ones from the first page.

## 1. Choosing the trust

A deploy, and a push of the box's config, carries one bearer token,
and the box accepts it if a `deploy_trust` block for that app (or the
`box` block, for config) verifies it. Four presets:

| Preset | Who mints the token | What the box stores | What it needs pinned |
|---|---|---|---|
| `github` | GitHub Actions, per run | nothing | `audience`, and `claim repository` with `claim ref` |
| `gitlab` | GitLab CI, per job (`id_tokens:`); `issuer https://gitlab.example.com` for a self-hosted instance, `https://gitlab.com` otherwise | nothing | `audience`, and `claim project_path` with `claim ref_path` |
| `oidc` | any other OIDC issuer: `issuer <url>` | nothing | `audience`, `issuer`, and `subject` (the issuer's own form of `sub`) |
| `local` | you, with `hotserve deploy-token` and a private key | the public half of your key, a file on the box | `public_key`, and `audience` (the box's name) |

What each costs:

- **OIDC** stores nothing. The box fetches the issuer's public keys
  over https and checks each token against them. A token is minted for
  the job and lives for as long as the issuer says, on the issuer's
  clock: ending or cancelling the job revokes nothing, and a token that
  leaks from a log deploys until that expiry. An `audience` alone is refused when
  the config loads: every project on the issuer can mint a token for
  any audience, so the block must also pin who, with an identity claim
  (`repository`, `project_path`, or `sub` for the generic preset). Pin
  the branch too, or a workflow edited on any branch deploys; for
  `github` and `gitlab` the box warns at load about a block that does
  not. The generic `oidc` preset gets no such warning, because the
  shape of its `sub` is the issuer's: check what the subject you pin
  scopes to, and when it names a project but no branch, pin a branch
  claim of the issuer's own beside it.
- **A key** is a stored secret: the private half sits in the runner's
  secret store, or on a laptop, and whoever reads it can deploy until
  you remove the public half from the box. For an app, the key is the
  whole deploy credential. Pinning a `claim` on a `local` block adds
  nothing to that: the key's holder writes the claims when they mint,
  so a pin only says what the token must contain, not who holds the
  key. For the box's config the key is weaker than it looks: a push
  applies only when a key on the box's own `signer` list signed every
  commit, so a stolen deploy key sends config but cannot land any.

Use OIDC where the runner has it. A key is for a runner that does
not, and for a laptop.

## 2. A key, end to end

On a Linux machine with `hotserve` on it, or in a container
([section 5](#5-minting-without-a-linux-hotserve)):

```sh
hotserve deploy-keygen --out example.key
```

```
wrote private key example.key (0600) and public key example.key.pub
```

An ed25519 pair: the private key as PKCS#8 PEM, the public key as
PKIX PEM. The command never overwrites: a name that exists is refused,
so a second key gets a second `--out`.

**Where each half goes.** The public key is a file the box reads, so
it goes to the box over SSH, as root, before the config that names it:

```sh
scp example.key.pub root@box.example.com:/etc/hotserve/example.pub
```

Then, in the box's repository, the app's block trusts it:

```caddyfile
app example {
	# …
	deploy_trust local {
		public_key /etc/hotserve/example.pub
		audience deploy.example.com
	}
}
```

Commit, signed, and push: the box validates the file (the key must
already be there, or the push is refused naming the path), installs
it and reloads. The `audience` names this box: a token minted for
another box that trusts the same key is refused here, and the box
warns at load about a `local` block with none.

The private key goes into the runner's secret store (a GitLab CI
variable of type *File*, say), or stays in a directory of your own on
the laptop. Nowhere else: not in the app's repository, not on the
box.

**The check job.** The box repository's `make check` runs `hotserve
validate` on each box's file as it stands in the checkout, and
validating loads every `public_key` from the path the file names. On
the runner that path is empty, and the check fails naming it. The
public key is public, so commit a copy beside the file and put it in
place in the check job before `make check`:

```sh
sudo install -D -m 644 deploy.example.com/example.pub /etc/hotserve/example.pub
```

(A GitLab job on the Docker executor runs as root in an image with no
`sudo`: drop the word there.)

**Minting.** One token per run, as late as the step that uses it:

```sh
HOTSERVE_TOKEN=$(hotserve deploy-token --key example.key --audience deploy.example.com)
```

The token lives for `--ttl` from now, five minutes unless you say
otherwise, and whoever reads it can deploy until then. The box refuses
one minted to live longer than its block's `max_token_ttl`, 24 hours
unless the block sets one, and the command warns on stderr above an
hour. `--subject <name>` puts a `sub` claim in it, which the deploy record
and the app's status show as `deployed_by`, and the journal's `deploy
authorized` line as `via`; `--claims k=v,k2=v2` adds any other claim.

**One key per app, and one for the box.** A key is the credential for
what trusts it, so give each app its own, and the box's `box` block
another. A key removed from one block then stops one thing.

**Rotation.** Make the new pair, copy its public half to the box under
a new name, add a second `deploy_trust local` block beside the old one,
pointing at it, and a second `install` line in the check job for the
new `.pub`. Push that. Swap the runner's secret for the new private
key. Then remove the old block, push again, and delete the old
`.pub` from the box. Two blocks accept either token in between, so no
run is refused on the way. A key you believe stolen skips the overlap:
remove its block and push.

## 3. An app's deploy from another runner

The app templates deploy with `scripts/deploy.sh`, which runs anywhere
there is `sh`, `curl` and git. Outside GitHub
Actions it reads the token from `HOTSERVE_TOKEN` and otherwise behaves
as the first page describes. What it takes:

| Variable | What it is |
|---|---|
| `HOTSERVE_URL` | the app's webhook, `https://deploy.example.com/example`; `https://` only, since the request carries the token |
| `HOTSERVE_TOKEN` | the token (section 2's, or the CI's own OIDC token) |
| `VERSION` | the release's version; the commit's first 12 characters unless set. Versions are immutable on the box, so the default deploys once per commit |

There are two ways to hand the box the release:

- **Push the tarball in the request** — `scripts/deploy.sh app.tar.gz`
  with a file. No release host, and no `artifact_allowlist` entry has
  to match it: the bytes come straight from the authenticated caller,
  capped at the app's `max_artifact_size`. The directive itself stays
  required, since an app with no allowlist at all is refused when the
  config loads; keep the template's entry. This is the path for a runner that
  publishes nothing, and for a laptop. The tarball itself must be
  built on Linux, for the box's architecture: the Node template's
  executable is the builder's own Node, and the box refuses a
  mismatch at deploy time (its message names a GitHub runner label,
  which is the hint for the GitHub workflow; elsewhere, pick the
  runner yourself). A Mac pushes a tarball built elsewhere. The
  checkout must be clean of uncommitted changes to tracked files, or
  the script refuses to label the build with the commit's name: set
  `VERSION` for an uncommitted build.
- **Give the box a URL** — `scripts/deploy.sh https://…/app.tar.gz`.
  The box fetches it, so the URL's host must be in the box's
  `artifact_allowlist`, path pinned on a shared host. Two more
  variables then help: `ARTIFACT_AUTH_HEADER`, sent verbatim as
  `Authorization` on the fetch, for a private host; and
  `ARTIFACT_SHA256`, the tarball's digest, the first field of
  `sha256sum`'s output (64 hex characters, nothing else), so the box
  refuses a download that hashes to anything else. The GitHub workflow
  sends both.

A job on **GitLab CI**, with the Node template's build and GitLab's
own token (`id_tokens:` sets the variable it names to a fresh OIDC
token for the job, with the audience given). The `tags:` line picks a
runner of the box's architecture, here gitlab.com's hosted arm64
runner for the first page's default box; gitlab.com's default runners
are amd64, and an amd64 box needs no line:

```yaml
deploy:
  stage: deploy
  image: node:26
  tags: [saas-linux-small-arm64]
  # One deploy at a time, as the template's workflow has it: the box
  # answers a second deploy of the same app 409 while one is running.
  resource_group: deploy
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"
  id_tokens:
    HOTSERVE_TOKEN:
      aud: hotserve
  variables:
    HOTSERVE_URL: https://deploy.example.com/example
  script:
    - npm run bundle
    - scripts/deploy.sh app.tar.gz
```

and the app's block on the box:

```caddyfile
deploy_trust gitlab {
	audience hotserve
	claim project_path your-group/example
	claim ref_path refs/heads/main
}
```

That shape is written from GitLab's documentation of its ID tokens,
its claims and its runners, and from the box's code. It has not been
run against a real GitLab project; if you do, say so in an issue. The
same job publishing the tarball to GitLab's package registry for the
box to fetch, with `curl` in place of the script, is in
[liveswap/README.md](../liveswap/README.md#gitlab-ci).

Any **other OIDC issuer** (CircleCI, Buildkite, a Kubernetes cluster)
is the `oidc` preset: its `issuer`, the `audience` you asked the
provider to mint for, and the `subject` the provider puts in `sub`,
whose form is the provider's own. The box requires the subject: with
only an audience, every workload on the issuer could deploy.

```caddyfile
deploy_trust oidc {
	issuer https://oidc.circleci.com/org/<org-id>
	audience hotserve
	subject <the provider's sub for this project>
}
```

With a **key** on a runner without OIDC, the job mints its own token
and the rest is the same:

```sh
HOTSERVE_TOKEN=$(hotserve deploy-token --key "$DEPLOY_KEY" --audience deploy.example.com) \
HOTSERVE_URL=https://deploy.example.com/example scripts/deploy.sh app.tar.gz
```

where `DEPLOY_KEY` is the path the secret store wrote the private key
to, and `hotserve` is on the runner's `PATH`
([section 5](#5-minting-without-a-linux-hotserve) has how it gets there).
One token serves the one request, so the default five minutes is
enough: the box checks it when the request arrives, however long the
deploy then takes.

A **401** from any of these means the box's block for the app does
not accept the token, or the URL names an app the box does not have (a
typo in `HOTSERVE_URL` answers the same 401). The script says what the
box holds the token against: the key, the audience, the subject and
claims the block pins. Outside GitHub Actions it cannot print the
values the token carries, which are the issuer's, or whatever
`deploy-token` was given, so hold those against the block yourself.
The box's own answer says no more, by design; its journal names the
check that refused it (`journalctl -u hotserve`, the `webhook auth
failed` lines).

## 4. The box's config from another runner

Only the workflow file in the box's repository is GitHub's. `bin/apply`
is what talks to each box, and any runner that gives it what the
Actions job does can run it:

- **A checkout with its full history.** The box checks every commit
  between the one it runs and the one being sent, and `bin/apply`
  bundles them from the checkout; a shallow clone is refused with a
  message saying so. On GitLab, that is the project's *Git shallow
  clone* setting, or `GIT_DEPTH` set to `0` on the job.
- **`hotserve` on `PATH`.** `bin/apply` runs `hotserve box webhook` to
  read each box's address from its file. `bin/install-hotserve
  default` installs the latest release's binary on a Linux runner with
  `curl`, `sha256sum`, `tar` and `sudo` on it; a GitLab job on the
  Docker executor has no `sudo`, so `apt-get install -y sudo` first,
  or take the release tarball yourself as
  [section 5](#5-minting-without-a-linux-hotserve) does and put the
  binary on `PATH`. `HOTSERVE=/path/to/hotserve` names it when it is
  not on `PATH`.
- **`HOTSERVE_TOKEN`**, a token the `box` block's `deploy_trust`
  accepts, carrying a `sha` claim that names the commit being sent.
  The box refuses a bundle for any other commit. `bin/apply` sends
  this one token with every request, the result polls included, and a
  push can be polled for up to 30 minutes, so the token must outlive
  the run: `--ttl 1h`.

With a key, the `box` block trusts it like an app's would, and the
job mints:

```sh
HOTSERVE_TOKEN=$(hotserve deploy-token --key "$BOX_KEY" --audience hotserve --ttl 1h --claims sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)) bin/apply
```

hotserve's own end-to-end suite runs `bin/apply`, unchanged, this
way: a `deploy_trust local` block on the box, a token naming the
commit, every answer the real box's.

With **GitLab's token** the `sha` claim comes for free: GitLab's ID
tokens carry the pipeline's commit as `sha`, so a `box` block of

```caddyfile
box {
	deploy_trust gitlab {
		audience hotserve
		claim project_path your-group/boxes
		claim ref_path refs/heads/main
	}
	# signers
}
```

and a job with `id_tokens: { HOTSERVE_TOKEN: { aud: hotserve } }`, a
full clone, `hotserve` installed, and `bin/apply` as its script, is
the Actions job on GitLab. Untested, as above.

Whatever mints the token, the rules of the box's repository hold: a
commit no listed key signed is refused, and so is a merge button that
rewrites one. The runner sends config; the signatures decide whether
it lands.

## 5. Minting without a Linux `hotserve`

hotserve is built for Linux on amd64 and arm64, and nothing else:
`hotserve deploy-token` does not run on a Mac. Two ways round it.

**A Linux container.** Each release's bare binary is on its releases
page as `hotserve_<version>_linux_<arch>.tar.gz`, beside a
`checksums.txt`, and runs in any Debian 13 container. With the private
key in the current directory, which the container sees read-only at
`/w` and writes nothing into:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/w:ro" -w /tmp debian:13-slim sh -c '
  apt-get -qq update && apt-get -qq install -y curl ca-certificates >/dev/null &&
  v=0.3.1 && arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) &&
  curl -fsSLO https://github.com/smallhoursorg/hotserve/releases/download/v$v/hotserve_${v}_linux_$arch.tar.gz &&
  curl -fsSLO https://github.com/smallhoursorg/hotserve/releases/download/v$v/checksums.txt &&
  sha256sum -c --ignore-missing checksums.txt >/dev/null &&
  tar -xzf hotserve_${v}_linux_$arch.tar.gz hotserve &&
  ./hotserve deploy-token --key /w/example.key --audience deploy.example.com'
```

Set `v` to the release the box runs, from its releases page. Each run
downloads the release again; a token a day is fine that way, a token
an hour wants the binary kept in an image of your own. The same
tarball is how a runner that is not Debian gets its `hotserve`: unpack
it and put the binary on `PATH`.

**Any JWT library.** A `local` token is a plain JSON Web Token, so
anything that signs one can mint it, in any language on any machine:

- Signed with the private key from `deploy-keygen` (ed25519, PKCS#8
  PEM), algorithm `EdDSA`. The box accepts no other algorithm on a
  `local` block.
- Header `{"alg":"EdDSA","typ":"JWT"}`.
- Claims the box checks:
  - `aud`: the block's `audience`, as a string or in an array;
  - `iat` and `exp`, both required, in seconds; `exp` at most
    `max_token_ttl` after `iat`; `exp` not yet past and `iat` not in
    the future, each with 60 seconds of leeway for clock skew;
  - every `claim` the block pins, as a string that matches exactly
    (`sub` for `subject`), and for the box's config `sha`, the full
    commit id, which the handler compares with the bundle's.
- An `nbf`, if you add one, is checked with the same leeway. Anything
  else is carried, not checked. `deploy-token` adds a random `jti` and
  the `--subject` and `--claims` you give it.

A token minted this way is accepted exactly as `deploy-token`'s is, and
refused for the same reasons, which the box's journal names.
