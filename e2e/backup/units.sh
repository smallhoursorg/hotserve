# The units suite. Runs inside e2e-backup-box as root, third of the five,
# against the unit files the package ships (copied into the image where
# the .deb puts them) and real systemd: the services start a run and a
# drill with the hardening the files say and nothing more — the
# measurement of that set, PLAN M54/M55 — bind their units to
# themselves, do nothing before setup, fail as units when they fail,
# order the drill behind a run, fire from their timers as written,
# refuse in a mount namespace of their own, and leave an operator's
# disk mounted.
# Nothing here enables a timer for good: a timer firing into another
# suite would take the run lock from under it.
