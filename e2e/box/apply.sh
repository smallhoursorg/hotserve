# The box channel end to end (box/DESIGN-box.md), inside the e2e box:
# the e2e-hotserve container, systemd as PID 1, hotserve.service as the
# hotserve user, and the packaged hotserve-box-apply.path and .service
# with the tmpfiles exchange tree. Commits are made and SSH-signed by
# git here, bundled the way the template's workflow bundles them, and
# POSTed to box_webhook with a `deploy_trust local` token naming the
# commit; the result is polled as the workflow polls it. Every answer
# is the real handler's and every install the real applier's — nothing
# is stubbed.
#
# The box's file is the e2e config itself, made into one a box applies:
# imports inlined (a signed file has none), a `box` block, and a
# box_webhook site on a bare hostname (served with an internal-CA
# certificate on 8443: the address rules allow no scheme or port), at
# <host>/Caddyfile in the repository. Its baseline is set by `hotserve
# init`, run inside that directory as the operator runs it.
#
# Runs last in `make e2e` (`docker compose exec`); puts the e2e config
# back at the end.
