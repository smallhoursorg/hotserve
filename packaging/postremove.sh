# hotserve package post-remove. dpkg runs it once the package's files
# are gone: `postrm remove`, then `postrm purge` when the removal is a
# purge, and on upgrades (`upgrade`, `failed-upgrade`) and their aborts
# (`abort-install`, `abort-upgrade`, `disappear`), which do nothing
# here: postinstall's `configure` reloads the manager.
#
# remove, and the purge that follows one: the manager drops the removed
# unit files (hotserve.service, hotserve-box-apply.path and .service,
# hotserve-backup's two services and two timers), and the path unit and
# the backup timers are masked, as dh_installsystemd has it, so that
# nothing of them comes back until an install unmasks and enables them
# (postinstall.sh). The persistent timers' stamps go too: with them,
# and the credential file kept, a reinstall reads a run and a drill as
# missed and catches up inside the install [M68].
#
# purge, on top of that — what the package made and nothing else holds:
#
# - the path unit's and the timers' enable state (deb-systemd-helper
#   purge), then the masks, in debhelper's order;
# - /etc/hotserve/Caddyfile, when it is a regular file (a symlink is
#   never followed, and is kept, named), and postinstall's temporaries
#   beside it; /etc/hotserve itself only once it is empty. The box's
#   key for secrets (age/, age.pub) and the env files decrypted with
#   it (secrets/) are KEPT, and said: the key is the one way to read
#   the secrets the box's repository holds, and only the person purging
#   knows whether that is over;
# - /var/lib/hotserve-package/, the starter's record: root's alone,
#   0700, nothing of an app's in it;
# - /var/lib/hotserve-box/, the box applier's exchange tree (stage/,
#   in/, work/, out/, the transaction record, applied.json): the
#   package's own, and the Caddyfile it protected is gone by then. Not
#   where anything is mounted at or under it: an rm there would remove
#   through the mount, so the tree is kept whole, and named;
# - /etc/hotserve-backup/repository.env is KEPT, and said: it holds the
#   repository password, the one way to read the backups already made
#   (PLAN D6). Whoever purges the package decides about the backups;
# - /var/lib/hotserve-backup: the record, the repository id and the
#   listing's stderr go; staging/ and restore/ are removed with rmdir,
#   never rm -r — a directory that is not empty holds copies of an
#   app's data that a killed run left, which root does not delete
#   (backups/README.md, "Who runs as what": root never reads or removes
#   app data) — and is named and kept;
# - /var/cache/hotserve-backup, restic's cache, owned by the account and
#   holding nothing of an app's, goes;
# - /run/hotserve-backup: what a killed command left there — its units,
#   its mounts of an app's data — preremove had the engine sweep at the
#   remove, while the program was there. On purge the run directory's
#   own files go (the lock, the list of units), and its directories by
#   rmdir alone: nothing is removed where anything is mounted at or
#   under it, or where what is mounted cannot be read — an rm there
#   would remove an app's files through the mount [measured in #153].
#
# The Caddyfile and the exchange tree under root's lock,
# /var/lib/hotserve-box/lock: a run of the applier holds it for its
# whole run and swaps the Caddyfile under it (box/apply.go, lock), and
# preremove stops the path unit, not a run under way (box/DESIGN-box.md,
# "The applier unit"), so a run could otherwise put a Caddyfile back
# after this script removed it. The lock is taken here before either
# removal and held through both, waiting up to 30s for a run — one is
# seconds (validate, swap, reload), so the wait covers many — and where
# it is still held, both are kept, named. Nothing starts a new run by
# then: the path unit is stopped and the program is gone. The lock file
# is opened only where it exists (a tree no run has used has none) and
# never made here.
#
# Never: /var/lib/hotserve (Caddy's state: TLS certificates) and
# /var/lib/liveswap (the deployed apps' releases and data) — root does
# not delete what an app or an operator put there; dpkg removes either
# only when it is empty, as any directory a package shipped. The
# hotserve and hotserve-backup accounts stay: system accounts are never
# removed.
#
# Every step is best-effort: a postrm that exits non-zero leaves dpkg
# with a package it can neither configure nor remove, so each failure
# is said on stderr, naming the path, and the script exits 0.
