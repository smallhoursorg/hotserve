# Package install smoke test, run as root inside the systemd container
# started by `make install-test` (dist/ mounted read-only at /dist).
#
# Fail-fast by design: each stage depends on the previous one, so the
# first broken assertion is the diagnosis. The Makefile dumps the
# hotserve journal on any failure.
#
# Stage 2 is the one that earns its keep: a real liveswap deploy under
# the shipped systemd unit proves that download + extract work in
# /var/lib/liveswap as the sandboxed hotserve user and that the app
# comes up as a transient unit under that user's own systemd manager —
# the exact packaging interaction (ProtectSystem=full, User=hotserve,
# lingering, the user@<uid> drop-in) no other test layer exercises.
# Stage 3 then proves the app survives the upgrade restart, and stage
# 3c that an upgrade restart the new binary refuses is reported. Stage
# 1b runs the box applier's units as shipped, with a stub for the
# applier and then with the real one, and stages 3 to 5 follow its path
# unit through upgrade, removal and an install after removal. Stage 5b
# follows the starter config through upgrades: none asks, a stock file
# follows the starter, and no other file is touched. Stage 6 purges:
# what the package made goes, the apps' data and the key stay.
#
# Stage 2c runs the "Set it up" lines of the backups guide — read out
# of docs/backups.md itself, mounted at /docs-backups.md, so the lines
# run are the lines written — as an administrator under sudo, against an
# S3 server in this container, and then holds the package to the table
# in backups/README.md: the timers enabled once, an administrator's
# disable kept across an upgrade, stopped and masked on remove, enabled
# again on reinstall, and purge keeping the credential file and saying
# why (expect_backup_state, a row per transition). And to the edges of
# each transition (#154): a run under way at an upgrade left alone to
# finish, the timers' stamps and a killed run's mounts gone with the
# package, and — stage 7 — an install where the account cannot be made,
# and what purge keeps said for what it is.
