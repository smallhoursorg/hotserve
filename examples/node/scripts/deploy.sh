#   scripts/deploy.sh --rollback <ver>   relaunches a version still on the box's disk
#
#   HOTSERVE_URL          the app's webhook, e.g. https://deploy.example.com/example  (required;
#                         https:// only, since the request carries the token)
#   HOTSERVE_ALLOW_HTTP   1 (exactly) lets HOTSERVE_URL be http://, sending the
#                         token in the clear: for a local test box only
#   VERSION               the release's version: 1 to 64 letters, digits,
#                         . _ -, not starting with . (the box's alphabet).
#                         Defaults to the commit (12 hex chars), and
#                         versions are immutable on the box, so the default
#                         deploys once per commit. For a pushed file it is
#                         refused while tracked files have uncommitted
#                         changes when the script runs, rather than put the
#                         commit's name on them: set VERSION for an
#                         uncommitted build (VERSION=wip-3, say). Not used
#                         by --rollback: that names its version itself
#   HOTSERVE_TOKEN        a deploy token. Not needed in GitHub Actions: with
#                         `permissions: id-token: write` one is minted per run.
#   HOTSERVE_AUDIENCE     the audience the box's deploy_trust expects (default: hotserve)
#   ARTIFACT_AUTH_HEADER  sent by the box as Authorization when it fetches the
#                         URL: "token <github token>" reads a release asset by
#                         its API URL, private repo or not (the workflow sends
#                         the job's own token)
#   ARTIFACT_SHA256       the artifact's digest as `sha256sum app.tar.gz` prints
#                         it: the box refuses a download that hashes to anything
#                         else, so a host serving other bytes than this build
#                         cannot deploy them (the workflow sends it). A pushed
#                         file is the request itself and a rollback fetches
#                         nothing: neither takes a pin, and one set is refused
#
# The deploy (or rollback: the same start, health gate and cutover,
# from a release already on disk) is streamed as it happens: one JSON
# line per phase, then the outcome — the app's status when the new
# version is live, or an error saying why it was refused (the old
# version keeps serving) — with the status code the request would
# have had in `http_status`. Every line is printed as it arrives, and
# a failure exits non-zero. A 401 — the box would not accept the
# token — is followed by what the box must trust for this run, since
# the box's own answer deliberately does not say (the reason is in its
# journal, for its operator).
#
# In GitHub Actions the same output is also dressed for the job page:
# the request's output in a collapsible group, a failure as an error
# annotation naming the phase and the cause, and one line in the job
# summary. Nothing else is sent or printed; a run from a laptop sees
# none of it.
